# SynergyAI
Decentralized AI Compute Network powered by Blockchain

## Project Overview

SynergyAI is a revolutionary ecosystem designed to democratize AI computing resources through decentralized collaboration, ensuring users maintain complete ownership of their data and models. The project integrates blockchain technology, distributed computing, and data sovereignty principles to create a fair, efficient, and secure platform for sharing AI resources.

### Core Pillars
1. **Collaborative Computing Network**: Global P2P computing resource network enabling shared computational power and optimized allocation
2. **Data Sovereignty System**: Users maintain complete control over personal data, with privacy guaranteed through encryption and permission management
3. **Triple Token Economy**: Sustainable value capture and incentive mechanisms through SYN, AIP, and DAT tokens

## Key Features

- Decentralized compute resource sharing and allocation
- End-to-end encrypted data storage and management
- Blockchain-based reward distribution system
- Task scheduling and result verification
- Governance proposal and voting mechanism
- Data marketplace for secure dataset exchange

## Core APIs

- **Task Status API**: Monitor and update task execution status
- **Rewards Claim API**: Claim earned tokens for compute contributions
- **Results Verification API**: Validate computation results and resolve disputes
- **Governance API**: Create and vote on network improvement proposals
- **Data Marketplace API**: List, search, and purchase datasets

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Storage**: IPFS, Encrypted distributed storage
- **Authentication**: Signature-based verification
