# SynergyAI System Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the SynergyAI system architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## Architecture Layers

The SynergyAI platform follows a layered architecture approach to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

### Frontend Layer

The frontend layer serves as the user interface for all platform interactions:

- **Web Application**
  - Built with React.js and Next.js
  - Responsive design using TailwindCSS
  - Client-side state management with React Context API and SWR for data fetching

- **Mobile Client**
  - React Native application for iOS and Android
  - Shared business logic with web application
  - Native device capabilities integration

- **Wallet Integration**
  - Web3 wallet connectors (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
  - Transaction signing and management
  - Identity verification

### Application Layer

The application layer handles business logic and orchestrates system functionalities:

- **API Gateway**
  - RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication
  - GraphQL interface for flexible data querying
  - Rate limiting and API security

- **Authentication Service**
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - JWT token management
  - OAuth2 integration for third-party auth
  - Web3 wallet-based authentication

- **Resource Management**
  - Compute resource allocation algorithms
  - Resource monitoring and health checks
  - Load balancing and scaling

- **Task Scheduler**
  - AI/ML task distribution
  - Priority-based queue management
  - Job execution monitoring
  - Result aggregation

- **Data Privacy Engine**
  - Data encryption and decryption
  - Access control mechanisms
  - Secure multi-party computation
  - Differential privacy implementation

### Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer ensures decentralization, trust, and tokenomics:

- **Smart Contracts**
  - ERC-20 token implementation (SYN and AIP tokens)
  - Resource validation and verification
  - Governance protocols
  - Staking mechanisms

- **Layer 2 Solution**
  - Optimistic rollups for transaction scalability
  - Gas optimization
  - Fast finality

- **Consensus Mechanism**
  - Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation
  - Validator selection and rewards
  - Slashing conditions for malicious behavior

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides the foundation for all other layers:

- **Distributed Storage**
  - IPFS for decentralized content addressing
  - Data sharding and redundancy
  - Content verification

- **Database Cluster**
  - MongoDB for flexible document storage
  - Sharding for horizontal scaling
  - Replica sets for high availability

- **Compute Network**
  - Federated nodes for distributed processing
  - GPU/CPU resource pooling
  - Edge computation support

- **Monitoring Stack**
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - AlertManager for notifications
  - Distributed tracing with Jaeger

## Inter-Layer Communication

Communication between layers follows these patterns:

1. **Frontend to Application Layer**: REST API calls, GraphQL queries, WebSocket for real-time updates
2. **Application to Blockchain Layer**: Web3 library interactions, contract event listeners
3. **Application to Infrastructure Layer**: Database drivers, IPFS client libraries
4. **Blockchain to Infrastructure Layer**: Oracle services, IPFS content addressing

## Security Considerations

The architecture implements security at every layer:

- **Frontend**: XSS protection, CSP, secure cookies
- **Application**: Input validation, rate limiting, CSRF protection
- **Blockchain**: Formal verification of contracts, multi-signature wallets
- **Infrastructure**: Network segmentation, encryption at rest and in transit

## Scalability Approach

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally at each layer:

- Stateless application servers behind load balancers
- Database sharding for data partitioning
- Layer 2 blockchain solutions for transaction throughput
- Federated compute nodes for processing capacity
